## R Basics
Before we can begin plotting, graphing and visualising our data, it is vital that we have a basic understanding of the tools R uses.

Let's start from scratch.

### The Assigment Operator
In R we use the assigment operator '<-' to assign a value to a **variable**.

**Variables** are objects, and are usually numbers or text.
```{r}
# Here we will assign a value (5), to a variable (x)
x <- 5 # Press ctrl and enter to run this line of code

# We can call this variable by simply typing it, and pressing ctrl and enter
x
# Or, we can find it in our environment (usually located in the top right hand pane)

# Now we will assign a value (3), to another variable (y)
y <- 3

# If we want we can overwrite the value of a variable
x <- 2

# Our variables can also store text
greeting <- "hello"

planet <- 'Earth'
```

Quite often in R we will want to assign a **vector** to a variable, not just a single value.

**Vectors** are a sequence of elements of the same type.

To do this, we simply need to wrap our vector in the concatanate **function**, c().

**Functions** are a sets of instructions which take some input data, and return output data. We call a function by writing the function names, followed by parentheses. e.g. function_name(argument).

```{r}
# For example, we can assign a variable (nums) with a vector of five numbers (13,42,29,64,51)
nums <- c(13,42,29,64,51)
```

Now that we have a vector, what if we want to take a specific value from it?

### Indexing
To extract a value from a vector we use square brackets, and a number, called an *index*. R indexes from one, meaning that to extract the first value from a vector, we would write **vector[1]**. Let's try this with our vector 'nums'.

```{r}
# Let's extract the third value from our vector 'nums'
nums[3]
```

So far we have focused on variables that we have defined, let's look at some existing data.

### Loading datasets
To load a built in dataset in R we simply need to assign the dataset's name to a variable.

```{r}
# Lets load the dataset 'iris' and assign it to a variable called df (short for dataframe).
df <- iris
```

Great, if we look at df in our environment we can see that df has 150 observations of 5 variables, or put simply, 150 rows and 5 columns.


```{r}
# To inspect the first few entries in our dataframe we can use the head function.
head(df)
```

### Loading Packages
Now that we have seen how to load a dataset, let's learn how to load a **package**.

**Packages** in R are combinations of datasets, functions and compiled code. To load a package we simply use the function library().

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Let's load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# If we do not have a package installed, we simply use the function install.packages(), to install it.
# Note that the argument for install.packages() takes quotation marks, but library does not.
# install.packages('ggplot2')
# Once the package is installed we can then run our previous libray command.
```

Simple!

Now we can move onto the more interesting material.

## ggplot2
To visualise our data we will be using the ggplot2 package. R comes with built in plotting tools, but ggplot2 has two distinct advantages over these:

- ggplot can handle both simple and complex visualisations.

- ggplot's plots are created in layers, so it is easy to build upon a plot adding detail where desired and needed.


Let's try plotting the **iris** dataset using ggplot2
```{r}
# Let's create a ggplot of Petal.Length against Sepal.Length
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length))
```


Note that because ggplot2 creates ggplot objects, if you don't specify a 'geom_X' nothing will be plotted

### geom_point()
```{r}
# Let's create a scatter plot using geom_point()
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length))+
  geom_point()
```

We have created our first ggplot. Now we can work on making it look more aesthetically pleasing. 

```{r message=FALSE}
# We can add a simple regression line using geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm')

# We can save this plot to a variable
plot1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm')

# We can then call this plot
plot1

# Add then continue to add to it
# We can change the colour of the points
# We can do so by giving R the name of a colour.
# It is also important to note that you can use 'color' and 'colour' interchangeably in R.
plot1 +
  geom_point(color = 'green')

# We can also use hexcodes.
plot1 +
  geom_point(color = '#fc766a')

# If we don't assign or re-assign this plot then when we call the plot our changes
# will not be saved
plot1

# Let's change the appearance of our regression line and then 
# save this plot to a variable called plot2

# To change our linestyle we shall use the linetype argument
# We shall choose 'dashed' 
plot2 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', color = 'red', linetype = 'dashed')

plot2
```

Pictured below are the other linetypes and the names used to specify each of them.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics( '/Users/fintanryan/2nd Year/_AA/ggplot2-line-types.png')
```


### geom_boxplot()

Now that we've created a few scatter plots using ggplot and geom_point() let's try making some boxplots. 
```{r message=FALSE}
# Using geom_boxplot let's create boxplots comparing the Sepal Length
# for the different species of iris

ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Species))+
  geom_boxplot()

# We can create a neater looking plot by swapping our x and y parameters
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length))+
  geom_boxplot()

# Let's call this box1 and add some colour
box1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length))+
  geom_boxplot()

# Note that the 'colour' argument for boxplots refers to
# the colour of the boxplot outline
# To change the colour inside the boxplots we use the argument 'fill'

# We can use one colour for all three boxplots
box1+
  geom_boxplot(colour = 'red')

# Or we can use a vector to add three unique colours
box1+
  geom_boxplot(colour = c('red', 'yellow', 'green'))

# We can also change the fill colour of our boxplots
box1+ 
  geom_boxplot(fill = c('blue', 'white', 'red'))
```

### geom_bar()
Now that we have explored scatterplots and boxplots let's try creating some barcharts.

For these we shall use the built-in dataset **diamonds**.
```{r}
# Let's start by assigning the diamonds dataset to df
df <- diamonds
```


We can take a quick look at the diamonds dataset using *head*, *summary* and *names*
```{r}
# Looking at the first few entries of our dataset
head(df)

# Gaining some relevant statistics
summary(df)

# Getting the names of our columns
names(df)
```

We can see that we have several pieces of information pertaining to each diamond. *carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price*.


Let's try plotting a histogram showing the cut of our diamonds
```{r}
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = cut))+
  geom_bar()
```

This plot is rather straightforward, but does not provide us with much information.

We can improve upon this by seeing the clarity of each cut of diamond.

```{r}
# Setting the fill colour to represent diamond clarity
ggplot(data = df)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

It can be hard to get an accurate sense of the distribution of clarity of diamonds of *fair* cut.

Let's place our bars side by side, instead of stacking them on top of each other.
```{r}
# To do this we use the 'dodge' argument when specifying our position
ggplot(data = df)+
  geom_bar(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity),
    position = 'dodge'
    )
  
```

This provides us with a more sensible visualisation.
